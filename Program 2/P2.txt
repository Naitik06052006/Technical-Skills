Question--> Given N array elements, count number of equilibirium index.An index is said to be equilibirium index if sum of all elements left of ith index is equal to the sum of all elements right of the array
note>>



Example: index:  0  1  2  3
        arr[4]= -3  2  4 -1
        left =   0 -3 -1  3
        right=   5  3 -1  0

        hence , index 2 is equilibirium index
        and count = 1;
        
Psudocode: 

1:.. Step 1 >> Read the array and find its length.
1:.. Step 2 >> Create the prifix array and store the full sum of the array.
1:.. Step 3 >> Initialize the count  to 0.
1:.. Step 4 >> Calculate the left sum of the array.
1:.. Step 5 >> calculate the right sum of the array.
